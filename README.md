Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, "The Gaming Room," wanted the expansion of an existing Android-exclusive game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based platform to make it accessible across various devices. They required software that can support multiple teams within a single game, allow many players per team, ensure unique game and team names, and retain only one instance of the game in memory using unique identifiers.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing the documentation, I comprehensively addressed both the requirements and constraints of the software, provided clear recommendations based on platform evaluations, and utilized a UML class diagram to visually depict and explain the domain model. This ensures that stakeholders have a clear understanding of the software design and the rationale behind certain decisions.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of drafting the design document helped in organizing thoughts and breaking down complex requirements into manageable parts. The UML class diagram particularly provided a clear visual blueprint for how the code's object-oriented structure should be laid out. It also allowed for forward-thinking about potential challenges (like cross-platform compatibility) that would be faced during the development phase.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would consider revising the "System Architecture View" section. While it's mentioned that this section may be important for other projects, it's potentially valuable to include a basic overview or diagram of the system architecture for this project. This could further illustrate how the various components of the application interact and where potential bottlenecks or points of failure might exist.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
User needs were interpreted from the requirements given by "The Gaming Room." Emphasis was placed on seamless multi-team gameplay and a unified gaming experience across platforms. Considering the user's needs is paramount in software design as it ensures that the end product aligns with user expectations, leading to increased user satisfaction, adoption, and longevity of the software.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The software design was approached by first understanding the client's needs and translating them into technical requirements. A domain model was then created using a UML class diagram to visualize the software's structure. For future projects, I would maintain this approach but also incorporate feedback loops with the client to ensure alignment at every stage. Additionally, I'd consider iterative design, prototyping, and employing user stories or use-case diagrams to better capture user needs and system interactions.
